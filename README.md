# AzDetect
The AzDetect Python script has been developed to demonstrate the detection, via email alerts, of highly suspicious actions that are likely to be linked to malicious actions within a target Azure environment. 

Please consider that the script should be used for PoC purposes only in order to famliarise with Azure's built-in alerting functions (e.g. email alerting).
